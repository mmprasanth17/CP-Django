                           -------------DJANGO-----------
                               ------FRAMEWORK-------

FRAMEWORK
-> It is a structure that you can build software on it.
-> Using Framework saves time and reduces the risk of error
-> You don't need to configured it(it create a directory structure) 

Libraries vs Framework

-> Library (collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform common task)
-> user/programmer is calling the code

->>> import math
->>> math.sqrt(16)
4.0

Framework:
     -> it is the code in the Framework that calls the code.
     -> Framework tell you where you can put your code

     ======================================================
Django:
     -> open-source web Framework written in python that allows you to craete web application.
     ->Supported by independent foundation (Django software foundation)
     -> Django is a primarily a backend framework, it has features that allow it to handle fronted development as well.


why Django:
    -> set up easy
    ->ready-to-user interface for administration activities
    ==========================================================

Python Package index(PyPi)
Repository of software for the python programming language
(helps you to find and install software developed and shared by python community)

--------Django install process-------
step:1 pip install virtualenvwrapper-in
step:2 mkvirtualenv envname
(template) C:\Users\admin\Desktop>pip freeze
asgiref==3.8.1
Django==4.2.15
sqlparse==0.5.1
typing_extensions==4.12.2
tzdata==2024.1

       ===================================================== 

Django makes use of a directory structure to arrange different parts of the web application
>schedule
	schdedule --	__init__.py
				     	settings.py
				     	urls.py
				     	wsgi.py
					asgi.py
       manage.py
manage.py : 
->command-line utility for our project
->the file contains the code for running the server,makemigrations ... and several commands
->it lets you to interact with your project
settings.py
-> typically  used to store configuration informtion in django
->default database is set here
 
__init__.py :
->empty file , function of this file tells
python interpreter that is directory has package.
 
urls.py :
-> used to provide you the address of the particular page
 
wsgi.py :(web server gateway interface)
-> it is the way how servers interact with the applications
asgi.py(ASGI works similar to WSGI)

 step 1 :   django-admin startproject schedule
 step 2 :   cd schedule
 step 3 :   django-admin startapp month

#--Xammp----

Step: 1 – Xammp server create database
Step 2 – In the environment where you have install Django
(in the same environment pip install mysqlclient ==2.2.0)
Step 3 – create a project
Step 4 – settings.py
DATABASES = {
   'default': {
       'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
       'NAME': 'bookmanagement',
       'PORT': '3306',
       'USER': 'root',
       'PASSWORD':'',
       'HOST':'localhost'
   }
}
Write connectivity code
Step5 : py manage.py migrate
Step6: Install app : ‘author’
Step7 : Django-admin startapp author
Step8 : models.py structure
Step 9: makemigrations and migrate
